These memes were previously shared in another repository simply titled "woke" but it seems that after getting the attention of acolytes in the woke cult the repository was reported to GitHub and, as expected from the start, GitHub (being obviously woke themselves) have finally removed/hidden/censored it (around November 5 2024) without any sort of justification. As if that will make any difference in the long run.

It seems the woke have learned nothing from their pathetic attempts to cancel X (formerly Twitter), along with heroic critics like Elon Musk and Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson, for daring to stand for free speech and mocking the literally fascist attempts to unite state and corporate power in order to censor all who disagree with any part of the woke cult's doctrine. Is anyone really surprised that woke cultists seem completely unable to accept reality and instead prefer to stubbornly persist with their pitiful fantasies?

I will continue uploading this content to new repositories and, if necessary, other accounts and websites. The delusional, psychotic, narcissistic, histrionic, authoritarian, fascist hall monitors who comprise the woke cult wish for the power to censor all who disagree with any part of their insane dogma, and they must continue to be exposed for the world to see how utterly pathetic and truly crazy these crybullies are.

If there's one good thing about this situation besides providing more amusement it's that it is more proof that I'm being targeted by the woke cult for the heinous crimes of daring to disagree with them and mocking them. See my fan-mail repository for other pathetic and amusing attacks against me which seem likely to be related.

Enjoy!
